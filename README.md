# Quizzify-App

I created this program using Trivia API.
The Open Trivia Database provides a completely free JSON API for use in programming projects.
The questions are requested from the trivia API and the QuizBrain.py implements the model for the quiz game.
I used Tkinter pakcage which is the standard python GUI toolkit to implement the GUI for the app.
